# Axis Overlap
Script made to receive four points on the x-axis and check whether they overlap each other or not.

## Usage
```shell script
>>> python src.overlap.py
1,3
2,5
(1,3) and (2.5) overlaps
```

- This script takes two lines as input. One for the first pair of points and the last one for the second pair.
- The first and second line should be comma separated valid numbers, with no spaces between them. e.g.
    
    ***Invalid***
    
    `1.56, 4.5`
    
    ***Valid***
    
    `1.56,4.5`
